# Strabismus 3D Vision Correction

This repository contains a Python-based application designed for the 3D vision correction of strabismus (a condition where the eyes do not properly align with each other).

## Project Overview

- **Language Used**: 
  - Python (100%)

## Features

- **3D Vision Correction**: Implements algorithms to correct vision alignment issues in 3D space.
- **Eye Tracking**: Utilizes eye-tracking technology to monitor and adjust eye positions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the application.
- **Real-time Processing**: Offers real-time processing for immediate feedback and correction.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nimanthaF/strabismus-3d-vision-correction.git
   cd strabismus-3d-vision-correction
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main application file:
   ```sh
   python main.py
